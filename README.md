Project Description - Mermaid Nail Salon
My TP is called 'Mermaid Nail Salon', which is very 
similar to a typical pizzeria game. But instead of 
serving customers pizza, you help customers paint 
and decorate their nails according to their preference. 
The top left corner will present a picture of how the 
customer would like her nails done. And your role is to 
make the nails so that it matches that picture by painting
them and adding  decorations. Scoring is based on how well
the nails are painted, the preciseness of decoration 
location, whether colors/decoration matched customerâ€™s 
order, customer's patience, etc. The goal is to reach 
300 points in 200 seconds.
